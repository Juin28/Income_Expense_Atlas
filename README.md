# Branch convention and Dev Process [NEVER PUSH THE CHANGES TO MAIN]
**After done with each part/feature**
1. Create a branch off main in the following format `<feature_nature>/<feature_name_or_fix>`
2. **Pull latest changes from main into branch before merging**
3. Push code only to your branch and create a PR to main once ready
